**Customers’ Feedback from Sprint 1 Review Meeting**

Customers were very satisfy with the productivity of our progress in this project because we are a bit ahead of the plan. She wish us to keep it like this and co-orperate to produce more satisfying progress. She really likes the way that we put in extra effort by actually go for them in our individual time to solve individual problems because in the meeting there are too many people and too many questions in limited time. Below is some comments posted by our client on Slack:

> “I will invite you to make some individual time with Bruce, or in smaller groups, if you would like assistance with the specific task you are working on. This will give us more opportunity to speak as an entire group at the actual meeting . I’m conscious of not taking up too much of your time , so im hoping you will see this as a benefit that you can utilize if it suits your needs.”

> “I was so impressed to hear you guys had already implemented a weekly scrum meeting and are utilizing the access to the office.” '

<h3><a name = "Title5"> 5. Organisation of project </a></h3>
<a href = "#content"><i> Click[Back To Content] </i></a>

Team Members
- Team Lead: Jie Gao
- Technical Lead: David Roussov
- Communication Lead: Lin Peng (Atlas) & You Hong
- Team member: Honggu Lin & Jiangshan Luo (Jason)

Development Approach
- Create prototype, present 

Engagement With Stakeholders 
- We had individual meetings and chats with client whenever any of us have questions (phone, video chat, meet in office)
- We had regular meeting at Wed 7-9pm every fortnight

Team Collaboration
- We will first have meeting with clients and discuss what we did and what we are going to do. If anyone have more questions can organise organize individual meeting time with the client. Then Jie Gao will create tasks on Jira and assign tasks to us. We will assign tasks on Jira and some people will work together on some related tasks. For example, in this week Honggu and Hong both designed the algorithms and will chat with Bruce to finalise the algorithms. After they finished implementing, David and other team members will be involved in testing. Jason setup database and helped us to analysis data to reformat them to have better structure so that Honggu and David can use them.

**Prototypes**

**Technical depth of outputs:**
- github has some weird merge conflict during commit push and pull. There are randomly appeared files that cannot be git ignored or deleted.
- React has its formal standard format for coding which makes it hard to write as we need to strictly follow the format.
- Issues with Grails tooling on particular operating systems impeding developer productivity.
- Gradle cached build dependencies that caused permission errors when committing to Git.
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing issues because the frontend is based on Webpack Dev Server which is a server separate to the Grails server and runs on a different port.

**Technical breadth of outputs: **
We tried and used different tools in order to optimise our output
- We used excel to design the algorithms, draw.io to create flow chart and UML
- assign for a public computer to build up public environment for testing
- balsamiq mockups for design
- Grails for back-end
- React + Redux for front-end
- Jest for testing
- SASS preprocessing
- Webpack for module bundling, minification and optimisation
- Babel transpilation
- Jira for agile project management
- Doodle for organising meeting
- Slack to communicate with Trade-up
- github to organise our project
- lonic creator/InVision for prototype
- Google drive for file/notes sharing
- React for front end development
- Mysql for database

**appropriateness of outputs:**
- We always show our progress to our client and discuss with them for improvement

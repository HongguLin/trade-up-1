Picture shows that we have 14 stories in peak, and we have finished 10 of them with remaining 4 stories.

**Value Delivered to Client**



**Effective and Appropriate Decision Making**
   
The team have engaged well in the planning and reporting process outlined by us at the beginning of the project.  
The team appear to be communicating well between themselves and are committed to achieving a customer product feature by the end of the semester. 


**Appropriate Documentation**
 
An improvement could be better demonstration of achieved outcomes at the conclusion of a sprint. This could be done at the fortnightly meetings. We encourage the group at next meeting to be ready to walk thru their outcomes as you would when delivering work to a client. 
The group has grown over the last few weeks in their understanding of the end result goal. 

**Technical Artifacts** 

The team have been very enthusiastic to attend meetings and communicate online. They have shown a great interest in making sure the project they deliver to us is one that will be useful to sell to our customers.

Team Members
- Team Lead: Jie Gao
- Technical Lead: David Roussov
- Communication Lead: Lin Peng (Atlas) & You Hong
- Team member: Honggu Lin & Jiangshan Luo (Jason)

[Detailed Information](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H-H8VXIQRvcCQ0B4kPnGwj3BTp5xR1Af0nwAcy8HQQo/edit#gid=0)

Development Approach
- Create prototype, present 

Engagement With Stakeholders 
- We had individual meetings and chats with client whenever any of us have questions (phone, video chat, meet in office)
- We had regular meeting at Wed 7-9pm every fortnight

Team Collaboration
- We will first have meeting with clients and discuss what we did and what we are going to do. If anyone have more questions can organise organize individual meeting time with the client. Then Jie Gao will create tasks on Jira and assign tasks to us. We will assign tasks on Jira and some people will work together on some related tasks. For example, in this week Honggu and Hong both designed the algorithms and will chat with Bruce to finalise the algorithms. After they finished implementing, David and other team members will be involved in testing. Jason setup database and helped us to analysis data to reformat them to have better structure so that Honggu and David can use them.

Acting On Feedback:
- Not respond to shadow team? Now we have Jie in charge of the Slack communication so whenever the shadow team have questions we will make sure that we respond to them quickly.
- Not working as a team? As specified above, everyone will have their role and we make sure everyone is on the same page through communication. We physically meet up and do work together, one person finished one part of the task and passed to the next person to do his part and finish a story together.

**Technical depth of outputs:**

- We spend lots of time figure out all the units and meanings of the construction variables. We spend lots of time and effort to calculate each dependencies and make sure we understand all the calculation and algorithms. Although it was a time consuming job and require lots of calculation and formula, now we have a full, deep and clear understanding of our customersâ€™ website and how they operate. This will provide great benefit for future development.
- github has some weird merge conflict during commit push and pull. There are randomly appeared files that cannot be git ignored or deleted.
- React has its formal standard format for coding which makes it hard to write as we need to strictly follow the format.
- Issues with Grails tooling on particular operating systems impeding developer productivity.
- Gradle cached build dependencies that caused permission errors when committing to Git.
- Cross Origin Resource Sharing issues because the frontend is based on Webpack Dev Server which is a server separate to the Grails server and runs on a different port.

**Technical breadth of outputs:**

![](https://github.com/Jasonluo666/trade-up/blob/master/project/image/sysarch.png?raw=true)

We tried and used different tools in order to optimise our output
- We used excel to design the algorithms, draw.io to create flow chart and UML
- assign for a public computer to build up public environment for testing
- balsamiq mockups for design
- Grails for back-end
- React + Redux for front-end
- Jest for testing
- SASS preprocessing
- Webpack for module bundling, minification and optimisation
- Babel transpilation
- Jira for agile project management
- Doodle for organising meeting
- Slack to communicate with Trade-up
- github to organise our project
- lonic creator/InVision for prototype
- Google drive for file/notes sharing
- React for front end development
- Mysql for database

**appropriateness of outputs:**
- We always show our progress to our client and discuss with them for improvement
